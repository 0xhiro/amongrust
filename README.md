# AmongRust ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ 

AmongRust is a tool developed by scientists and researchers at MAT. It reveals the imposters you"ve been hiding in your sus code. Basically, AmongRust draws imposters in your code using code comments LOL.
AmongRust is totally non-destructive, and your code should work as normal (maybe), because it only adds comments to your code.
Be careful, the imposters may be very few, or outrageously many. This is a feature, not a bug, and there is no way to remove the imposters. ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ 


I'm just kidding you can reverse the effect by using the IAMTHEIMPOSTER argument like "cargo amongrust -- IAMTHEIMPOSTER", which is very sus if you ask me.
It is possible to undo the changes made to your code because of my IMPOSTER_DETECTION_ALGORITHM which took me 9 years to develop.

Of course, you can also manually delete the comments if you want, because they"re just comments, but i highly recommend using the IAMTHEIMPOSTER argument because that's what it was made for.

Note: this crate was made by Hiro at 2AM in his mum's basement. there is no guarantee that it will work as expected. Use AmongRust at your own risk. It took 34 long minutes to start and finish this AMBITIOUS project. Please give this project a star on Github and subscribe to my youtube channel for fun programming videos, well, except you are an impo****

# USAGE

'cargo install amongrust'

That's it. you're done. Now run "cargo amongrust" in your project directory, then check your source code.

How to undo: 'cargo amongrust IAMTHEIMPOSTER'

That's it. you're done.

DO NOT USE AMONGRUST IN YOUR COMPANY'S CODEBASE!!!
